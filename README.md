# HI FOR EVERYONE 

  I am glad that you visited my little repository where I posted my laboratory work that I did for the machine learning course at KPI. In the process of training, I learned a lot of different things, so I decided to leave it here both for myself and for the people who will come here.

Each folder contains several files:
> 1) Date folder (in which the dataset is stored).
> 2) Main file (code of our program).
> 3) The task that was posted by the teacher.
> 4) README file.

Each main file is a file as type `"IPYNB" (.ipynb)` that was pre-launched, and you can see it running.
